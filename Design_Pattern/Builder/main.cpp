#include <iostream>

// Builder Design Pattern
// 1. The Motivation behind the Builder DP is that Don't put too many argument into the constructor it reduce the productivity
// 2. Opt for the piecewise construction of the object
// 3. Builder DP provides an API for construction of the Object step by step
// 4. When peice wise construction is complicated it provides and API for construction of the object


int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
