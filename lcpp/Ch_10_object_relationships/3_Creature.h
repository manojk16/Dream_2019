 *      This Point2d class is a composition of its parts: location values x and y are part-of Point2D,
 *      and their lifespan is tied to that of a given Point2D instance. Now letâ€™s design our Creature. Our Creature is going to have a few properties:
 *      a name, which will be a string, and a location, which will be our Point2D class.
