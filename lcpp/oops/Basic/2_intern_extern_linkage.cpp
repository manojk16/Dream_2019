/*
 Linkage: weather multiple instance of the an identifier refer to the same variale or not
 Normal local variable is refer to the the variable with no linkage
 Ibternal Linkage : Variables with internal linkage can be used anywhere within the file they are defined in,
 but can not be referenced outside the file they exist in.
A variable with external linkage is called an external variable. Variables with external linkage can be used
 both in the file they are defined in, as well as in other files.

 If we want to use a global varaible as internal so we can make it by using static keyword
