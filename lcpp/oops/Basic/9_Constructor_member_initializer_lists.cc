When the classâ€™s constructor is executed, m_value1, m_value2, and m_value3 are created.
Then the body of the constructor is run, where the member data variables are assigned values.
This is similiar to the flow of the following code.

int m_value1;
double m_value2;
char m_value3;

m_value1 = 1;
m_value2 = 2.2;
m_value3 = 'c'

As we know that some type of data like const and ref should be initialize once they are declared

// Perhaps surprisingly, variables in the initializer list are not initialized in the order that they are specified in the initializer
// list. Instead, they are initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class.
