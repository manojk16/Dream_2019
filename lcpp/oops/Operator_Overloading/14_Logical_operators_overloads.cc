// Because the increment and decrement operators are both unary operators and they modify their operands,

//Hereâ€™s a different example with an overloaded operator>, operator<, operator>=, and operator<=:

#include <iostream>

	friend bool operator >(const Cents &c1, const Cents &c2);

	friend bool operator <=(const Cents &c1,const Cents &c2);
