Because dereference has a lower precedence than dot, we must parenthesize the
dereference subexpression.
**************************Bit Wise Operator************************************
1. The left-shift operator (the << operator) inserts 0-valued bits on the right.

2. The behavior of the right-shift operator (the >> operator) depends on the type of the
left-hand operand: If that operand is unsigned, then the operator inserts 0-valued
bits on the left; if it is a signed type, the result is implementation definedâ€”either
copies of the sign bit or 0-valued bits are inserted on the left
